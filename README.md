# Dual-Security-System

This project is a security system based on the LCP2148 microcontroller, which integrates multiple components for robust access control. The system is designed with an EEPROM (AT24C256) for secure password storage, a keypad for user input, and an LCD for visual feedback. Additionally, the R305 fingerprint module provides biometric authentication. The microcontroller utilizes its on-chip external interrupt feature, enabling responsive and efficient dual authentication, combining password and fingerprint verification. This approach ensures enhanced security, making the system suitable for applications requiring high levels of protection and user verification.
