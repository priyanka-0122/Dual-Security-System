# Dual-Security-System

LCP2148 microcontroller-based Security System interfaced with EEPROM (AT24C256) for password storage, a keypad for entry, LCD for display, and an R305 fingerprint module for biometric access. The system effectively accessed the on-chip external interrupt, offering robust dual authentication for secure access control.
